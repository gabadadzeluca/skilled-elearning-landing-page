## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt using more efficient HTML, using flex in css. Practised mobile first workflow. Also used position: relative; for the first time



### Continued development

I have written this code for 3 times in total, correcting and being more efficient each time. I think I could have asked for held, instead of doing something incorrectly over and over again.
